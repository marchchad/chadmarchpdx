    p One of my latest projects is creating my own site to tinker with new technologies I'm interested in as well as a place to showcase previous work and share my interests.

    p Ever since visiting 
      a(href='www.baileystaproom.com') Bailey's Taproom
      |, I knew I wanted my kegerator to have a display like theirs, but better! The highlights of this project include:
      ul
        li Live kegerator pour feed
        li Live temperature feed
        li Historical data for average keg life, average pour volume, and more
        li (Possibly) Live webcam feed to see who's pouring!
